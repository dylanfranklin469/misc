# Pendulum Expectations #
## Expectations with extreme drive frequency ##

Assumptions
1. Rigid
2. Ideal pendulum
3. Frequency of drive ($\omega_d$) $»or«$ Natural Frequency ($\omega_0$) 
   * $\omega_0 = \sqrt(g/L)$
4. Amplitude « pendulum size
5. Mass is dropped around $\theta \approx 90\degree$


Expectation
- I believe that the outcome is dependent on if $\omega_d$ and $\omega_0$ are in phase over time due to constructive and destructive interference.

## Expectations with equilibrium displacement and nonstatic pivot

Assumptions
1. The pivot point will abruptly stop at maximum displacement
2. Ideal pendulum
3. Typical X & Y coordinate system

Expectation
- The mass will gain slight acceleration during the period when the pivot point moves down, leading to the displacement angle to be elevated. This could be seen as a mechanical increase of energy in the system.

## Pendulum oriented at unstable equilibrium angle with downward pivot point motion
