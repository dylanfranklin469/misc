## Probability Normalization ##
Normalizing probability distributions is vital for proper arithmetic.

Before we give a proof for the importance of normalization, we
must assume the following:
<br/>
  
  1) The probability distribution function (*PDF*), $F(x)$, is a continuous function
  2) Events are independent, regardless of the previous outcome.
  3) 
<br/>
Say we have the PDF $F(x)$ = (√2πa²)⁻¹
